# network_connectivity_dynamic_model
Agent-based model to calculate convergence and adaptiveness by manipulating connecitvity dynamic and content biases. As described in Segovia Martin, J., Walker, B., Fay, N. &amp; Tamariz, M. (2019). Network connectivity dynamics affect the evolution of culturally transmitted variants.. connectivity dynamics (early, middle and late full-population connectivity); content bias, or a preference for high-quality variants; coordination bias, or whether agents tend to use self-produced variants (egocentric bias), or to switch to variants observed in others (allocentric bias); and memory size, or the number of items that agents can store in their memory
