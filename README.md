# Network connectivity dynamics model
Agent-based model to calculate convergence and adaptiveness by manipulating connecitvity dynamic and cognitive biases. As described in Segovia Martin, J., Walker, B., Fay, N. &amp; Tamariz, M. (2019). "Network connectivity dynamics affect the evolution of culturally transmitted variants" https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06598
